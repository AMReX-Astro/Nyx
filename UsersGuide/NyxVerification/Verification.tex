\subsection{90Mpc Box Problem from Cosmic Data Arxiv} 

\noindent This is a standard test problem with initial particle positions and velocities
taken from the Cosmic Data Arxiv (http://t8web.lanl.gov/people/heitmann/arxiv). 

\noindent The size of the box is 90.14 Mpc on a side.

\noindent The initial redshift is $z=50;$ we end the calculation at redshift = 0; equivalently at $a = 1.$

\noindent (Recall that $a = 1 / (1+z).$
