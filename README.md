# Nyx
*an adaptive mesh, cosmological simulation code*

*******************************************************

PLEASE NOTE:  Nyx has been migrated from BoxLib to AMReX.

If you would like to use the latest version of Nyx, you will
need to download AMReX from

https://github.com/AMReX-codes/amrex

`Nyx` is an N-body hydro cosmological simulation code with 
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).  `Nyx` uses an unsplit PPM approach 
for the hydrodynamics, a particle representation of dark matter, 
and multigrid to solve the Poisson equation for self-gravity.

`Nyx` is parallelized with MPI + OpenMP.

More information on Nyx can be found here:

http://amrex-astro.github.io/Nyx/

If you prefer to run with the BoxLib-based version, then 
you can use the "boxlib" branch (which will no longer be updated).

## Getting Started

There is a User's Guide in `Nyx/UsersGuide/` (type `make` to build
from LaTeX source) that will guide you through running your first
problem.  

## Development Model

New features are committed to the `development` branch.  Nightly
regression testing is used to ensure that no answers change (or if
they do, that the changes were expected).  No changes should ever
be pushed directly into `master`.

On the first workday of each month, we perform a merge of
`development` into `master`, in coordination with `amrex`. 
For this merge to take place, we need to be passing the regression tests.  
To accommodate this need, we close the
merge window into `development` a few days before the merge day.
While the merge window is closed, only bug fixes should be pushed into
`development`.  Once the merge from `development` -> `master` is done,
the merge window reopens.

## Physics Included
For the description of the N-body and adiabatic hydro algorithms in Nyx, see
Almgren, Bell, Lijewski, Lukic & Van Andel (2013), ApJ, 765, 39:
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...765...39A

For the reaction and thermal rates of the primordial chemical composition gas 
(and convergence tests in the context of the Lyman-alpha forest), see
Lukic, Stark, Nugent, White, Meiksin & Almgren (2015), MNRAS, 446, 3697:
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.446.3697L

For the synthesis model of the UV background, 
which provides the photo-ionization and photo-heating rates, 
we include the prescription of Onorbe, Hennawi & Lukic (2016):

## Post-processing

Nyx interfaces with two post-processing suites, Reeber and Gimlet. Reeber uses
topological methods to construct merge trees of scalar fields, which Nyx in
turn uses to find dark matter halos. Gimlet computes a variety of quantities
about the simulation, including optical depths, Lyman-alpha fluxes, power
spectra (both 1-D "line-of-sight" as well as fully 3-D), and probability
distribution functions. These suites are fully MPI-parallel and can be run
either "in situ" or "in-transit", or with a combination of both. A detailed
description of their usage is provided in the Nyx User Guide.
