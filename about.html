	      <h3>hydrodynamics + gravity</h3>
	    </header>

	    <p>Castro's hydrodynamics is based on a compressible flow
	      formulation in Eulerian coordinates.  Castro uses a
	      dimensionally-unsplit 2nd order Godunov method for
	      construct the fluxes through the interfaces of each cell
	      (a choice of piecewise linear or piecewise parabolic
	      reconstruction + characteristic tracing is
	      provided).  The hydrodynamics is designed to work with
	      a general (convex) equation of state, and a variety of
	      Riemann solvers are provided.</p>

	    <p>Newtonian gravitational forces are supported through
	      either a simple monopole approximation or the full
	      Poisson equation using geometry multigrid.  Isolated
	      boundary conditions for the Poisson solver allow for
	      modeling complex mass distributions.  Several implementations
	      for incorporating gravity into the energy equation are
	      implemented, including an explicit source term and
	      a conservative flux formulation.</p>

	      <h3>radiation</h3>
	    </header>

	    <p>Radiation hydrodynamics is supported through the
	      <a href="https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/CastroRadiation">CastroRadiation</a>
	      git repo.  This integrates gray or multigroup flux
	      limited diffusion in a mixed-frame or comoving frame,
	      including all coupling terms to O(v/c).  The radiation
	      update is done implicitly using the linear solvers
	      provided by
	      the <a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/project/linear_solvers/software.php">hypre</a>
	      package.

	      <h3>microphysics</h3>
	    </header>

	    <p>A default &gamma;-law equation of state and
	      general-composition non-reacting network as distributed
	      in the main Castro git repo.  Additional equations of
	      state (including a general stellar EOS) and many nuclear
	      reaction networks are distributed in
	      the <a href="https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/Microphysics">Microphysics</a>
	      git repo.  Maintaining them in a separate repo allows all of the
	      BoxLib astrophysics codes share the same microphysics.


	    <header class="major">
	      <h3>reproducibility</h3>
	    </header>

	    <p>All Castro plotfiles store information about the build
	      environment (build machine, build date, compiler version
	      and flags), run environment (output date, output dir,
	      number of processors, wall clock time), and code
	      versions used (git hashes for the main Castro source and
	      BoxLib source, and support repos, if available).  This
	      allows for a recovery of the code base used for previous
	      results.</p>

	    <p>Castro is run through a nightly regression test suite that
	      checks the output, bit-for-bit, against stored benchmarks
	      for many of the problem setups (including real science 
	      runs).</p>

	    <header class="major">
	      <h3>adaptive mesh refinement</h3>
	    </header>

	    <p>The approach to AMR in Castro uses a nested hierarchy
	      of logically-rectangular grids with simultaneous
	      refinement of the grids in both space and time.  The
	      integration algorithm on the grid hierarchy is a
	      recursive procedure in which coarse grids are advanced
	      in time, fine grids are advanced multiple steps to reach
	      the same time as the coarse grids and the data at
	      different levels are then synchronized.  A separate
	      synchronization is done for gravity.</p>

	    <a name="performance"></a>
	    
	    <header class="major">
	      <h3>parallel performance</h3>
	    </header>

	    <p>Castro uses a hybrid programming model based on MPI and
	      OpenMP.  Distribution of grid patches to nodes using MPI
	      provides a natural coarse-grained approach to
	      distributing the computational work, while threading of
	      loops over zones in a grid using OpenMP provides
	      effective fine-grained parallelization.  Castro uses a
	      new tiled approach to OpenMP that can effectively take
	      advantage of manycore processors like the Intel Phi's.</p>
