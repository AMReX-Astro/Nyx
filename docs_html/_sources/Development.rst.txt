Work in Progress
================

Here we list work in progress; code pieces related to these efforts are already in the GitHub repo
but the functionality has not been finished yet and is thus not fomally relesed to the
community.  We provide this list for completness and clarity of the source code.


Active Galactic Nuclei
----------------------

We are implmenting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) subgrid model based on Bondi accretion
of gas onto a blackhole, and feedback of energy into the surrounding medium.  Ongoing
development is (mostly) contained inside Source/AGN/ folder.


Massive neutrinos
-----------------

Simulating massive neutrinos as particles is implemented in Nyx via separate
particle container.  Tests are ongoing.
