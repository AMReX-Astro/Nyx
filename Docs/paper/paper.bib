	abstract = {We present a new N-body and gas dynamics code, called Nyx, for large-scale cosmological simulations. Nyx follows the temporal evolution of a system of discrete dark matter particles gravitationally coupled to an inviscid ideal fluid in an expanding universe. The gas is advanced in an Eulerian framework with block-structured adaptive mesh refinement; a particle-mesh scheme using the same grid hierarchy is used to solve for self-gravity and advance the particles. Computational results demonstrating the validation of Nyx on standard cosmological test problems, and the scaling behavior of Nyx to 50,000 cores, are presented.}

	abstract = {We present MAESTROeX, a massively parallel solver for low Mach number astrophysical flows. The underlying low Mach number equation set allows for efficient, long-time integration for highly subsonic flows compared to compressible approaches. MAESTROeX is suitable for modeling full spherical stars as well as well as planar simulations of dynamics within localized regions of a star, and can robustly handle several orders of magnitude of density and pressure stratification. Previously, we have described the development of the predecessor of MAESTROeX, called MAESTRO, in a series of papers. Here, we present a new, greatly simplified temporal integration scheme that retains the same order of accuracy as our previous approaches. We also explore the use of alternative spatial mapping of the one-dimensional base state onto the full Cartesian grid. The code leverages the new AMReX software framework for block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) applications, allowing for scalability to large fractions of leadership-class machines. Using our previous studies on the convective phase of single-degenerate progenitor models of SNe Ia as a guide, we characterize the performance of the code and validate the new algorithmic features. Like MAESTRO, MAESTROeX is fully open source.},

Numerical results that illustrate the accuracy of the code and the relative merit of various implemented schemes are also presented."

The FLASH code was developed to study the problems of nuclear flashes on the surfaces of neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as in the interior of white dwarfs. We expect, however, that the FLASH code will be useful for solving a wide variety of other problems. This first version of the code has been subjected to a large variety of test cases and is currently being used for production simulations of X-ray bursts, Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities, and thermonuclear flame fronts. The FLASH code is portable and already runs on a wide variety of massively parallel machines, including some of the largest machines now extant.},

GASOLINE2 is the most recent version of the GASOLINE code for parallel hydrodynamics and gravity with identical hydrodynamics to the CHANGA code. As with other Modern SPH codes, we prevent sharp jumps in time-steps, use upgraded kernels and larger neighbour numbers and employ local viscosity limiters. Unique features in GASOLINE2 include its Geometric Density Average Force expression, explicit Turbulent Diffusion terms and Gradient-Based shock detection to limit artificial viscosity. This last feature allows GASOLINE2 to completely avoid artificial viscosity in non-shocking compressive flows. We present a suite of tests demonstrating the value of these features with the same code configuration and parameter choices used for production simulations.},

To effectively investigate these phenomena computationally, applications must similarly support modeling these phenomena on enormous ranges of scales; furthermore, they must do so efficiently on high-performance computing platforms of ever-increasing parallelism and complexity. We describe Enzo-P, a Petascale redesign of the ENZO adaptive mesh refinement astrophysics and cosmology application, along with Cello, a reusable and scalable adaptive mesh refinement software framework, on which Enzo-P is based. Cello's scalability is enabled by the Charm++ Parallel Programming System, whose data-driven asynchronous execution model is ideal for taking advantage of the available but irregular parallelism in adaptive mesh refinement-based applications. We present scaling results on the NSF Blue Waters supercomputer, and outline our future plans to bring Enzo-P to the Exascale Era by targeting highly-heterogeneous accelerator-based platforms.},

Using simulations of increasing size and complexity, working up in length and mass scale and to lower redshifts, a connected narrative is built up covering the entire epoch. In the first part of the paper, we draw on results we and our collaborators have achieved using the Enzo cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code. Topics include the formation of Population III stars, the transition to Population II star formation, chemical enrichment, the assembly of the first galaxies, their high redshift galaxy statistics, and their role in reionization. In the second part of the paper we highlight physical difficulties that will require new, more physically complex simulations to address, drawing from a broader literature survey. We discuss the healthy interplay between self-consistent numerical simulations and analytic and semi-analytic approaches. Finally, we discuss technical advances in hardware and software that will enable a new class of more realistic simulations to be carried out on exascale supercomputers in the future.},
