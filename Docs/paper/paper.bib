Nyx follows the temporal evolution of a system of discrete dark matter particles gravitationally coupled to an inviscid ideal fluid in an expanding universe. The gas is advanced in an Eulerian framework with block-structured adaptive mesh refinement; a particle-mesh scheme using the same grid hierarchy is used to solve for self-gravity and advance the particles. Computational results demonstrating the validation of Nyx on standard cosmological test problems, and the scaling behavior of Nyx to 50,000 cores, are presented.}

	abstract = {We present MAESTROeX, a massively parallel solver for low Mach number astrophysical flows. The underlying low Mach number equation set allows for efficient, long-time integration for highly subsonic flows compared to compressible approaches. MAESTROeX is suitable for modeling full spherical stars as well as well as planar simulations of dynamics within localized regions of a star, and can robustly handle several orders of magnitude of density and pressure stratification. Previously, we have described the development of the predecessor of MAESTROeX, called MAESTRO, in a series of papers. Here, we present a new, greatly simplified temporal integration scheme that retains the same order of accuracy as our previous approaches. We also explore the use of alternative spatial mapping of the one-dimensional base state onto the full Cartesian grid. The code leverages the new AMReX software framework for block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) applications, allowing for scalability to large fractions of leadership-class machines. Using our previous studies on the convective phase of single-degenerate progenitor models of SNe Ia as a guide, we characterize the performance of the code and validate the new algorithmic features. Like MAESTRO, MAESTROeX is fully open source.}

We expect, however, that the FLASH code will be useful for solving a wide variety of other problems. This first version of the code has been subjected to a large variety of test cases and is currently being used for production simulations of X-ray bursts, Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities, and thermonuclear flame fronts. The FLASH code is portable and already runs on a wide variety of massively parallel machines, including some of the largest machines now extant.},

@article{Teyssier2002,
   abstract = {A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES, is presented. It has been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree-based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code (Kravtsov et al. 1997), with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated with shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density ACDM universe are reported, with 2563 particles and 4.1 × 107 cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 81923. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloe temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

Unique features in GASOLINE2 include its Geometric Density Average Force expression, explicit Turbulent Diffusion terms and Gradient-Based shock detection to limit artificial viscosity. This last feature allows GASOLINE2 to completely avoid artificial viscosity in non-shocking compressive flows.

   abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics,
but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation
codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is
necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's
computing hardware. Here we discuss recent methodological progress in the
GADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over
the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in
time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in timescales, in
computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special
MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a
more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum
conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the
one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different
flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving
formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with
gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus
allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of
future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to
high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle
number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released
to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and
substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple
model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power
spectrum estimator, and an initial conditions generator based on second-order
Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

We describe Enzo-P, a Petascale redesign of the ENZO adaptive mesh refinement astrophysics and cosmology application, along with Cello, a reusable and scalable adaptive mesh refinement software framework, on which Enzo-P is based. Cello's scalability is enabled by the Charm++ Parallel Programming System, whose data-driven asynchronous execution model is ideal for taking advantage of the available but irregular parallelism in adaptive mesh refinement-based applications. We present scaling results on the NSF Blue Waters supercomputer, and outline our future plans to bring Enzo-P to the Exascale Era by targeting highly-heterogeneous accelerator-based platforms.},

Using simulations of increasing size and complexity, working up in length and mass scale and to lower redshifts, a connected narrative is built up covering the entire epoch. In the first part of the paper, we draw on results we and our collaborators have achieved using the Enzo cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code. Topics include the formation of Population III stars, the transition to Population II star formation, chemical enrichment, the assembly of the first galaxies, their high redshift galaxy statistics, and their role in reionization. In the second part of the paper we highlight physical difficulties that will require new, more physically complex simulations to address, drawing from a broader literature survey. We discuss the healthy interplay between self-consistent numerical simulations and analytic and semi-analytic approaches. Finally, we discuss technical advances in hardware and software that will enable a new class of more realistic simulations to be carried out on exascale supercomputers in the future.},
