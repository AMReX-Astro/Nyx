All of the subroutines in this directory (except fort_advance_gas) 
are called from subroutine fort_advance_gas, 
which is called directly from Nyx::just_the_hydro in Nyx_hydro.cpp

In Nyx_advection_3d.f90:
  fort_advance_gas
  advance_gas_tile
  umeth3d
  ctoprim
  consup
  cmpflx
  riemannus
  divu

In normalize_species_3d.f90:
  normalize_species_fluxes
  normalize_new_species

FORT_ADVANCE_GAS --- (tiling) ---> ADVANCE_GAS_TILE

ADVANCE_GAS_TILE ---   ctoprim   ---  uflaten  (in flatten_3d.f90)

                 ---   umeth3d   ---  ppm*     (in ppm_3d.f90)
                                 ---  trace*   (in trace_3d.f90 or trace_ppm_3d.f90)
                                 ---  uslope   (in slope_3d.f90)
                                 ---  trans*   (in trans_3d.f90)
                                 ---  cmpflx  ---  riemann --- analriem

                 ---   divu 

                 ---   consup    ---  normalize_species_fluxes 

                 ---   enforce_minimum_density

                 ---   add_grav_source  (in add_grav_source_3d.f90)

                 ---   enforce_nonnegative_species (NOTE: FORT_ENFORCE_NONNEGATIVE_SPECIES is also called from the C++;
                                                          FORT_ENFORCE_NONNEGATIVE_SPECIES then calls enforce_nonnegative_species;
                                                    both of these routines are in Nyx/Source/Src_3d/enforce_nonnegative_species_3d.f90)
